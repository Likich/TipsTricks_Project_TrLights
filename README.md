## Some info

I used Faster RCNN to find traffic lights on video. Training data consists of LISA, Bosch and S2TLD datasets. You can find links for this datasets in "useful links" file. The code with downloading all datasets is in Datasets.ipynb file. <br><br>
You can find some expirements with night data in "Detection/" directory (Night model training.ipynb). <br><br>
Faster RCNN gives good results in finding traffic lights but one main downside is speed. So, since Faster RCNN is not fast enough to find boxes for each frame, each 4-th frame was processed. <br><br> 

## Experiments

The experiments included attempts to use the Yolo model and the transformer DETR. It was especially interesting to test the second approach because the transformer architecture for images is a new idea, and a paper with it was published on May 28th, 2020 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12872). It was manageable to detect traffic lights, i.e. one class using this network (DETR experiment.ipynb). With YOLO there were difficulties primarily with the interaction with google colab. Many settings for successful operation of this network are Linux-friendly, which was not available. <br>
Thus, the Faster R-CNN architecture with the FPN backbone was used in this paper. You can read more about its work in the following article: https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/understanding-feature-pyramid-networks-for-object-detection-fpn-45b227b9106c. For convenience a brief and informal description of all neural networks was created, this file was meant only to facilitate understanding of the architectures: Architectures.pdf. <br><br>
